    <!-- HELLO THIS IS AN ANNOTATION -->
     <h4> <un> a little about me</un> </h4>

    <p>I was born and raised in <em> Honolulu, Hawaii</em>, but my roots are deeply tied to South Korea. My parents immigrated to the U.S. and only spoke Korean at home as it is their first/main language, which made learning both Korean and English a bit tricky when I was younger. Over time, though, I grew to really appreciate my culture. Most of my family still lives in South Korea, so I spend my summers visiting them, exploring the cities, and also to spend time with my friends. I'd say it's a big part of who I am today.</p>
